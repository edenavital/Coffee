        <p class="text-color">We have so many to choose from!<br>
        Who has the time or the money to try everything on the market?<br>
        If you tried every type of coffee brand and brew out there, it would take years.<br>
        I have narrowed down the best coffee beans from the most caffeinated, the best dark roast, and every signature flavor nestled in between.<br>
        There's nothing like fresh ground coffee, you just need the right beans for your personal taste.</p>
